Welcome to my personal portfolio website where I showcase some of my high-school projects made using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. You can access it here at: https://brendan-ly.github.io/index.html

The website contains clickable project links ordered in a grid, with navigation buttons and a home menu on each project page.
